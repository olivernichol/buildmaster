# BuildMaster
BuildMaster is a code deployment GUI for itch.io, acting as a GUI wrapper for their incremental and delta patch tool, butler.

I've published the source code to Build Master, less to be a reflection of my ability but more just a testament to having done this for longer than there is subsidisable evidence for otherwise. Figured that was important to showcase.

Consider this code fairly inactive. To the best of my knowledge it all still works, and I've pushed a new release for this and itch.io to update my information on the platform, as well as to add a fair amount of extra documentation to the code.

Otherwise, hope this proves useful!
